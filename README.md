# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset, aiming to extract valuable insights and identify patterns related to passenger survival. The analysis is carried out using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The goal is to visualize key relationships between features like age, fare, class, gender, and survival, to better understand factors influencing survival rates.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Gain a deeper understanding of the Titanic dataset through statistical exploration.
- Visualize the distribution and relationships between key features.
- Identify potential trends or anomalies that could be useful for predictive modeling.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="">Dataset</a>

## Key Insights from EDA
- **Survival Rates**: First-class passengers, especially women and children, had higher survival rates.
- **Age vs Survival**: Younger passengers tended to have a higher survival rate.
- **Fare and Class**: Higher fares were correlated with better survival rates, especially in first class.
- **Family Size**: Passengers traveling with more family members (SibSp, Parch) had a better chance of survival.

## Tools and Libraries
This analysis uses the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting basic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations (e.g., pairplot, heatmap).

## Conclusion
 The Titanic dataset reveals clear trends in survival based on socio-economic factors. Understanding these patterns is crucial for future safety planning and analysis
